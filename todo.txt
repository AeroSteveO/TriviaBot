<~theDoctor> Steve-O do you have a timeout for TriviaBot 
<~theDoctor> in general
<~theDoctor> as in nothing is said, it dies
<~Steve-O> Yeah
<~Steve-O> 3 or 5 questions
<~Steve-O> Don't remember which but I think it's 3
<~theDoctor> you should do a decreased timeout after !stop
<~theDoctor> from any number of people
<~theDoctor> for that situation
<~Steve-O> The timeout is based on channel activity too
<~theDoctor> yea
<~Steve-O> Not successful answering of questions
<~theDoctor> but as in if BODpc was the only one here
<~theDoctor> did !stop to end it
<~theDoctor> it should end
<+BODpc> ^
<~theDoctor> so maybe a notice to them, get everyone else to say stop or i will end after this question
<~theDoctor> and notice the channel if nothing is said by the end of this question, the game will end
<~theDoctor> something like that
<~theDoctor> so it cant be abused
<~Steve-O> But znc pretty much prevents the channel from being empty completely
<~theDoctor> i mean if BODpc is the only active
<~theDoctor> we were playing
<~theDoctor> fizzled out to go fap
<~theDoctor> he is all thats left
<+BODpc> (._.)
<~theDoctor> it shouldnt have to wait 3q to stop if he is the only active one
<~Steve-O> Ehh yeah, how do I determine use activity though? Who the previous ten lines were from? 
<~Steve-O> Get the number of active users from that
<theDoctor> here is how i would do it
<theDoctor> when someone does !stop it messages the user and lets them know: trivia bot will stop after the next question or as soon as 2 other people use !stop
<theDoctor> and notifies the channel that 'i will stop after the next question if there is no activity or immediately if !stop is used;
<theDoctor> and make the pm to the user include no activity as well for stoping after next question
<theDoctor> and if no one responds to trivia bot, then it stops
<theDoctor> or messages in the channel rather
<theDoctor> i would also put in a case, if someone else does !stop in the time window, but not 2, then it should continue as if no activity
<theDoctor> also, for the timeout if no one answers questions, you should do the same timeout for 1 person
<theDoctor> so you cant just rack up points
